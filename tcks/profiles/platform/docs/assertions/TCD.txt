Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a
  specification. A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an
  implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected
  results developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific
  assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least
  one test case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the
  specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total
  number of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------
- Total testable assertions derived from Java EE 7 Specifications and Javadoc: 

       15295 specification assertions
     + 11311 API assertions          
     -------------------------------
       26606 testable assertions     

- Total testable assertions tested

       10149 specification assertions tested
     +  9468 API assertions tested          
     --------------------------------------
       19617 testable assertions tested    

  - 66.36% of testable specification assertions tested
  - 83.71% of testable API assertions tested          
  - 73.73% of all (specification and API) assertions tested


- Assertions were identified through the use of CTS Tools and hand markup
  (hand markup was required for the Java EE specifications, non Javadoc)

- Number of tests in CTS 7: 49,591
    - Note, this total may change before CTS 7 ships.

- API Signature Coverage: 100% of all public and protected members are
  validated by the signature tests included with the CTS 7.

- All Java EE 7 implementations must also pass the following stand-alone TCKs:
  - JSR 222 JAXB TCK [24,637]
  - JSR 346 Web Beans (Context dependency injection for the Java EE platform) [1479]
  - JSR 349 Bean Validation [758]
  - JSR 330 Dependency Injection for Java [50]
* Note, [Number of tests in TCK]


Quality Assurance
-----------------
- CTS was run using representative configurations of the JavaEE Reference
  Implementation on the following platforms, note all platforms use Java SE 7:
   * Ubuntu 12.10
   * Fedora 18
   * openSUSE 12.2
   * Solaris 11.1 Sparc
   * Solaris 11.1 X86
   * Solaris 10 Sparc
   * MacOS 10.8
   * Oracle Linux Server release 6.4
   * Windows XP Professional
   * Windows 2008

- CTS was run with the following databases:
   * Oracle 11.2
   * MySQL 5.6
   * Postgres 9.2
   * DB2 10.1
   * Microsoft SQL Server 2012
   * Sybase ASE 15.7

* Note, not all permutations of platforms and DBs were tested.

- Code quality was demonstrated through the use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the standard CTS User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
The JavaEE CTS version 7 provides a comprehensive set of tests to ensure
all implementations of the Java EE 7 specifications are compatible.  As with all
TCKs it is impossible to provide tests for 100% assertion coverage.  Note, while
the CTS may not have tests for all assertions in the Java EE 7 Platform, all
implementations of the platform must be compatible with the specifications.

Untested assertions are due to the effects of late specification changes, and
the availability and cost of test development resources.
