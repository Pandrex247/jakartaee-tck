These directories (ap and spec) were generated by running the 
following:
   > cd TS_HOME/install/connector/bin
   > ant -f $TS_HOME/bin/coverage-build.xml connector

These directories contain the generated assertion doc info for
Connector 1.7 technology.  

note: proper generation of these docs requires correct version numbers of 
      Connector technology be specified in the following (3) files:
	TS_HOME/bin/coverage-build.xml
	TS_HOME/internal/docs/connector/ConnectorSpecAssertions.xml
	TS_HOME/internal/docs/connector/ConnectorJavaDocAssertions-nums.xml

The generated information can then be used to calculate figures that get rolled 
into the TCD.txt document.
