TCK Coverage Document for JSR-322 Java TM EE Connector Architecture 1.6 Specification


TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests 
- Signature Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness


Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a specification.
  A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected results
  developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least one test
  case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total number
  of methods defined by the specification.


Coverage
--------

- Total testable assertions derived from Java EE Connector Architecture 1.6 Specifications and Javadoc: 

       107 specification assertions 
     + 334 API assertions           
     -------------------------------
       441 testable assertions     

- Total testable assertions tested

       76 specification assertions tested 
     +193   API assertions tested         
     --------------------------------------
      269   testable assertions tested    

  - 71.00% of testable specification assertions tested 
  - 58.00% of testable API assertions tested           
  - 61.00% of all (specification and API) assertions tested 
 
- Assertions were identified through the use of CTS Tools and hand markup
  (hand markup was required for the Java EE Connector Architecture specification)

- Number of tests in Java EE Connector Architecture 1.6:   103  
    - Note, this total may change slightly before CTS ships.

- API Signature Coverage: 100% for all defined public and protected members and validated
  by the signature tests included with the JavaEE CTS.


Quality Assurance
-----------------
- Connector TCK tests were run using representative configurations of the 
  Reference Implementation on the following platforms, note all platforms 
  use Java SE 6: XXX
   * Solaris 10 sparc
   * Solaris 10 X86
   * Solaris  9 sparc
   * Solaris  9 X86
   * Java Desktop System
   * Red Hat (RHEL) 4.0
   * Red Hat (RHEL) 3.0
   * Windows 2003
   * Windows XP Professional
   * Mac OS 10.4.4
- Code quality was demonstrated through the use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the standard CTS User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
The Java EE Connector Architecture version 1.6 provides a comprehensive set of tests to ensure
all implementations of the Java EE Connector 1.6 specifications are compatible.  As with all
TCKs it is impossible to provide tests for 100% assertion coverage.  Note, while
the CTS may not have tests for all assertions in the Java EE 6 Platform, all
implementations of the platform must be compatible with the specifications.

Untested assertions are due to the effects of late specification changes, and the
availability and cost of test development resources.
