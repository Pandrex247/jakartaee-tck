TCK Coverage Document for JSR-343 Java Message Service 2.0 Specification


TCK Components:
---------------
- User's Guide
- Compatibility Rules
- Configuration Instructions
- Test Suite
- API Tests 
- Signature Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- Framework Code
- JavaTest TM Harness


Terminology of Metrics
----------------------
- Assertion: A specific statement of functionality or behavior derived from a
  specification. A testable assertion is one that can be validated in an
  implementation by testing.
- Test: A binary application (or script) comprised of one or more Test Cases.
- Test Case: A single set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected
  results developed to verify an implementation's conformance with a specific
  assertion.
- Specification Assertion Coverage: Ratio of all assertions tested by at least
  one test case to the total number of testable assertions defined by the
  specification.
- API Coverage: Ratio of methods directly exercised by test cases to the total
  number of methods defined by the specification.

Assertion details.  These details will be removed from the final TCD but are
checked into revision history so we can backtrack the numbers later, if we need to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Assertions found by the coverage tools (May 15th, 2013 coverage report):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  spec total       		:  286
  spec tested total		:  267
  spec percentage tested	:  93.04%
  api total        		:  719
  api tested total 		:  719
  api percentage tested		:  100.00%

Number of tests in JMS TCK: 918

--------------
Important Note
--------------
The spec assertions total and spec tested total includes spec assertions for the 
standalone JMS 2.0 TCK as well as the Java EE 7 CTS. Since a single spec assertion
document is created for both the TCK and CTS it must be understood that many of the
the spec assertions listed in the document are specific to the Java EE 7 environment
only. So these spec assertions will not be in the JMS 2.0 TCK tests but in the Java
EE 7 CTS tests. The Java EE 7 CTS tests contains all the JMS 2.0 TCK tests plus the
additional test directories that cover the spec assertions that are specific to the 
Java EE 7 environment.

Quality Assurance
-----------------
- TCK was run on the following platforms, note all platforms use
  Java Platform, Standard Edition 7 (Java SE 7):
   * Solaris 11 Express (x64 architecture)
   * Solaris 10 Sparc
   * MAC OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.1+)
   * Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8
   * Oracle Linux 6
   * RedHat Enterprise Linux 6
   * Ubuntu Linux 12.10
   * Suse Enterprise Linux 11

- Code quality was demonstrated through the use of code reviews and inspections
- User's Guide was constructed from the standard TCK User's Guide template
- Documentation instructions were verified and tested


Justification of Adequacy
-------------------------
The JMS TCK Version 2.0 provides a comprehensive set of tests to ensure that all
implementations of the Java Message Service 2.0 Specification are compatible. As 
with all TCKs it is impossible to provide tests for 100% assertion coverage. Note, 
while the TCK may not have tests for all assertions in the Java Message Service 
2.0 Specification, all implementations must be compatible with the specification.

Untested assertions are due to the effects of late specification changes, optional
API's, optional functionality, conditions that cannot be easily tested, and the 
availability and cost of test development resources.
